This is a pymol plugin intended to make working with ribosomal
pdb files easier.  It parses the pdb header and attempts to
make some reasonable inferences about the RNAs and proteins.
It will also attempt to annotate the nearly 150 ribosomal RNA
helices.  Finally, it has some basic functionality to color residues
based upon arbitrary chain or molecule names.

In the 2d directory is a perl script which can color the utexas
ribosomal secondary structure maps.  It does so via the hilariously
crude method of simply inserting color declarations into the original
postscript files.  As such it is not currently very (at all) extensible.


The main thing I would like to do with this code is to have a 2d picture
appear when one selects various helices in the 3d map displaying them in 
both formats.

All functionality is usable via the plugin/ribosome menu in the python 
control window.  Most functions in it are also exported to the pymol
command line interface.
