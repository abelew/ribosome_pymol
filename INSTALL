1.  Copy this directory and its subdirectories into ${PYMOL_HOME}/modules/pmg_tk/startup
    ${PYMOL_HOME} in windows is usually c:\program files\delano scientific\pymol
    On unix-like operating systems this can vary widely, the fastest way is probably to run
    `locate pmg_tk`  On my Debian system it is /usr/share/pyshared/
2.  Launch pymol, go to plugins and hit 'install plugin' and find the plug_helices.py inside
    the pymol directory.
3.  Relaunch pymol.
